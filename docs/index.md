## About This Project

The main product of this project is a workable cook recipe sharing social network application, where users can share their recipes and tag them by categories. Shared recipes can be searched and viewed by other users.

This project is inspired by cook-at-home experience in COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid risk of virus spreading, cooking at home has become the major choice for meals. As self cooking becomes more frequent, the need of learning and sharing cook recipes is growing.

Main motivation and target of this project is to research on user interface design of social network application on both desktop and mobile platform. As there are many existing social network applications, we plan to use them as user interface samples and research on features of their designs.

## Need Finding Process

### Survey

To research on needs of sharing and learning cooking recipes, a survey was made and posted on the Internet. The survey was distributed mainly to fellow students and close friend and family members. By December 1, 2020, 12 responses are collected. 


This [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6FNNFOBVXOURQfh4W6RaSL6ExfVbgYcQJPau--7qes3nZqw/viewform?usp=sf_link) directs to the online survey.

The responses indicates that learning cooking recipes by social network is common among respondents. Almost all of them use one or more social network platforms, and more than half of them are learning cooking recipes on them. However, the most popular form of cooking recipe sharing is videos on YouTube or other localized video sharing platforms rather than social networks based on text and photos. Also, very few of respondents who frequently cook for themselves are willing to share their recipes, which represents a potential challenge on the quantity and quality of the contents of the product.

This [link](./survey_findings.md) represents survey feedback statistics.

### Interview

Three fellow students were interviewed on potential needs of recipe sharing social networks. The interview went informally and unstructured. The finds of the survey was shared to in the interview, the interviewees agreed on the need of learning cooking recipes on social network, and the fact that the form of videos have advantages of presenting cooking contents compared to texts and photos. Possible solutions were brainstormed and discussed, but none of them was found practical or implementable.

## Prototypes

We used [Miro](https://miro.com/) and [Modao](https://modao.cc/) as wireframe and mockup prototyping tools. The prototyping work includes three stages: wireframe, mockup, and webpage.

### Wireframe and Mockup Prototypes

Firstly, wireframes was created. At this stage the focus is to setup cross-platform layouts based on responsive webpage design principals, and apply interface efficiency rules.

Then wireframe prototypes was concreted to mockup prototypes, which illustrates style and color design of page elements to evaluate the visual effects of different designs.

The following images are examples of wireframe and mockup prototypes.

### Webpage Prototypes

Webpage prototypes are made to be interactable, and can cover most of frequently used functions of the software. To evaluate the prototypes, we tested our webpage prototypes on classmates and other fellow students. The test use sessions were performed without guidance, in which we can observe how the tested user perform their usage to find potential design flaws or problems if any difficulties occurred in the test use session.
